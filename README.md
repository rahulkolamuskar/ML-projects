# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning-based customer churn prediction system for a subscription-based service or business. The goal of the project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (unsubscribe or discontinue their subscription) using historical customer data that includes usage behavior and demographics. Machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, are used to make predictions.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and directories:

- `churn_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset and any data-related files.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you need the following libraries and tools installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
